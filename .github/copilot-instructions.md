# NSX — Copilot Instructions

NSX is a vanilla-JS UI skin for the Decent DE1 espresso machine, built on the
Decent.app gateway. It runs as a single-page web app (no build step) served
locally to the machine. The repo is an **npm-workspaces monorepo** (`packages/*`);
npm is only used for monorepo management — the skin itself has no bundler.

## Dev model (read this first)

- **The Decent app serves `packages/nsx/src` as the web root.** That folder must be
  self-contained: `index.html` references core at `core/…`.
- **Source of truth for shared code is `packages/core/src`.** `packages/nsx/src/core/`
  is a **generated copy** (git-ignored). **Edit core only in `packages/core/src`,
  then run `npm run sync-core`.** Never edit `packages/nsx/src/core/` directly.
- No build step: edits take effect on reload. UI language is **German**.
- To run: in Decent, "Settings → Live-edit from folder…" → point at `packages/nsx/src`.

## Layout

```
packages/
  core/src/        # DOM-FREE shared package (SOURCE OF TRUTH)
    config.js, api.js (NSXApi), translations.js (NSXI18n)
    core.js        # window.NSXCore — event bus + register() for commands/selectors
    store.js       # NSXCore store (settings) — extracted Phase 2
    push.js        # NSXCore push/debounced helpers — extracted Phase 2
  nsx/src/         # NSX skin = served web root
    index.html     # loads core/* then modules/* (load ORDER matters)
    modules/app.js # ~11k-line orchestrator (DOM + state + wiring)
    modules/ui.js, router.js, settings.js, screensaver.js
```

`index.html` script order: config → translations → api → core → **store → push** →
router → ui → screensaver → app → settings. A core module that registers on
`NSXCore` must load after `core.js` (and after `api.js`/`translations.js` if it uses
`NSXApi`/`NSXI18n`).

## Ground rules

0. **Core-first (check before you implement).** Before writing any non-trivial
   function, check whether core already has it — read `packages/core/README.md` and
   `grep packages/core/src` for the concept; reuse `NSXCore.<fn>` if it exists. Any
   pure logic / business rule / API interaction other skins would need goes in
   **core**, not the skin. Only DOM-fused / UI-shaped code stays skin-side. This
   keeps the skins from re-implementing the same logic twice.
1. **Ask, don't assume.** Unclear intent → ask before writing code.
2. **Simplest thing that works.** No abstractions/flexibility that weren't requested.
3. **Don't touch unrelated code**, even if it could be improved.
4. **Flag uncertainty explicitly** instead of guessing.
5. **Shot API:** only write `annotations` (not `metadata`/`shotNotes` — deprecated).
   `extras` merges at field level. Post-shot actions go in `_runPostShotActions()`.

## monorepo / multi-skin refactor (branch `monorepo-multi-skin`)

Goal: extract logic from `app.js` into a shared headless **`NSXCore`** so a second
(Vue) skin can later consume the same core. `main` keeps shipping normal NSX
releases (tag `v*`); the refactor lives only on this branch (release tag `nsx-v*`).

**NSXCore API (`core.js`):** `on/off/emit(name, payload)`, `register(impl)` to attach
commands/selectors. A bridge re-emits api.js window events as semantic events
(machineConnected, scaleWeight, machineState, waterLevel, liveShot, …).

**The domain-extraction phase is essentially complete.** For the full, current
per-domain API (steam / hotwater / flush / schedule / grinder / bean / shot /
profile / workflow / machine / mapping), read **`packages/core/README.md`** — that
is the authoritative reference, kept next to the code. Don't re-derive it from this
file.

### Pattern to follow when adding to / editing core (still applies)
- **One domain per commit.** Mirror the existing domains: an IIFE that grabs
  `window.NSXCore`, guards it exists, then `NSXCore.register({...})`.
- **Keep DOM in app.js**; move only state + logic to core. Where app.js still needs a
  value, expose a core **selector** and keep a thin same-named delegator in app.js so
  call sites stay unchanged (minimize diff in the 11k-line file). Live skin state a
  core function needs is **passed in as a parameter**, never read from an app.js
  global (keeps core app-state-free).
- Add the new `<script src="core/<file>.js">` to `index.html` in correct load order
  (after any core module it depends on).
- After editing core: **`npm run sync-core`**, then `node --check` the changed files.
- **Verify in Decent before committing** (the big file hides reference/load-order bugs).
- **When to extract:** pure data transformation or business rule → core; DOM-fused or
  UI-shaped state → stays in app.js (see the core README's "what stays in the skin").

## Model guidance

Sonnet is sufficient for these domain extractions — the pattern is established and
documented. Work in small steps, **one domain per commit**, verify in Decent each
time. Switch to Opus for the gnarlier shared-state cases or a subtle
reference/lifecycle bug.
